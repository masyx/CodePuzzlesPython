'''42. Trapping Rain Water
Hard

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 
Constraints:
n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

from typing import List


'''Key Concept: 
The amount of water on top of any bar is always min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]. 
This is central to the trapping rain water problem. It ensures that the height of water 
doesnâ€™t exceed the smaller boundary.
