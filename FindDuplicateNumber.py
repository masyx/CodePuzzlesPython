Given an array of positive numbers, nums, such that the values lie in the range [1,n], inclusive, 
and that there are n+1 numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in nums. 
There is only one repeated number in nums.

Note: You cannot modify the given array nums. You have to solve the problem using only constant extra space.
